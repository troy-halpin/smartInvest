# smartInvest
Hackathon project for HackGT

We wanted to make an iOS app using Swift that leverages the abundance of data in BlackRock's Aladdin API to make
long-term stock predictions. This was going to be achieved by using the Random Forest Machine Learning algorithm
with Pyspark in Microsoft Azure, however we changed to Linear Regression. In the end, we couldn't get everything
working in time, so currently the chart in the app is more of a hardcoded example than an enlightened data-driven
decision. Our data visualization was done using HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery and the Chart.js library, inside of a UIWebView.
We didn't finish, but for a team of 2 with very little to no ML experience, we're pretty proud of what we accomplished
in the timeframe. Thanks for taking a look!
